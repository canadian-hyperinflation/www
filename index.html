            </div>
            <h2>-1. Mathematical Preface: Compounding and Inevitable Breakdown</h2>
            <p>
                Before talking politics or policy, start with basic math. Any percentage growth or deterioration
                that persists over time compounds. That means the variable either doubles over and over,
                or it halves over and over. You do not get a stable endpoint from a constant growth rate.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rule of 72:</strong> a quantity growing at <em>g%</</em> per year doubles in roughly
                    72 / g years. Debt growing 6% per year doubles in ~12 years. Prices growing 6% per year cut
                    your currency’s purchasing power in half in the same time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Debt vs. income:</strong> if public debt grows faster than the tax base, the
                    debt-to-income ratio eventually explodes. There is no steady state. You either slow it,
                    reverse it, or you default/restructure in some form (inflation, haircut, or outright default).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Currency vs. inflation:</strong> if you accept a chronic inflation rate that is
                    higher than the interest you pay on savings, the real value of the currency is mathematically
                    guaranteed to erode toward zero over long horizons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Quality decline:</strong> if service quality, infrastructure, or productivity decline
                    at a small percentage per year, the effect over a generation is huge; systems hollow out
                    even if each year feels “almost the same.”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Applied to Canada: with <strong>debt, obligations, and currency dilution all compounding faster
                than real productivity</strong>, the Canadian dollar is on a mathematical path where, over enough time,
                its purchasing power collapses. You can choose <em>how</em> and <em>when</em> the system breaks or resets,
                but if the compounding trend lines do not flip, <strong>collapse of the currency’s value is not a question of “if”,
                only “when.”</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="scenario-note">
                This is the core claim of the site: given current growth and decay rates, and absent a deliberate reversal,
                the Canadian economic system is set on a path where its currency cannot hold long-term value.

            <h2>0. Summary: Why the System Is Doomed (Without a Reset)</h2>
            <p>
                Canada has quietly built a three-way trap:
                <strong>high public debt</strong>, <strong>record household leverage</strong>, and
                <strong>weak productivity growth</strong>. Those three together mean:
                every shock hits harder, every interest-rate move hurts more, and every delay in reform pushes the system
                closer to a forced, ugly adjustment.

                <em>how soon, how fast, and whether the break shows up first in inflation, the currency,
                    or the bond market.</em>

                Section 1 &mdash; Structural Fault Lines
            </div>
            <h2>1. From “Safe” to Stretched: The Core Fault Lines</h2>
            <p>
                Since the 2008 crisis, Canada has slowly traded balance-sheet strength for comfort:
                crisis-era stimulus never fully unwound, housing turned into a national leverage trade,
                and low rates were treated as permanent. Now the bill is coming due.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Public debt:</strong> total public debt (federal + provincial + other) has climbed to
                    levels more typical of heavily-indebted European states, and it rose sharply again after 2020.
                    See the IMF and federal fiscal monitors for the trend.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Household leverage:</strong> Canadians carry one of the highest household-debt-to-income
                    ratios in the developed world, with mortgage debt dominating. The Bank of Canada itself flags this
                    as a financial vulnerability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Housing dependence:</strong> real estate and construction feed GDP, tax revenue,
                    household wealth, and political expectations. A serious housing correction would punch
                    multiple parts of the system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Productivity:</strong> business investment per worker and productivity growth have been weak
                    for years. Even mainstream and conservative think tanks (C.D. Howe, Fraser Institute,
                    Macdonald-Laurier) warn that Canada is slipping on competitiveness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Demographics:</strong> an aging population and rising health and pension obligations
                    mean long-run spending pressure is up while the tax base growth rate is not.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                None of these on their own guarantees collapse. But together, they form a structure that is
                mathematically hard to sustain once interest rates, growth, or markets move the wrong way.

        <!-- 2. Feedback Loops -->

                Section 2 &mdash; How Systems Break
            </div>
            <h2>2. The Feedback Loops That Turn Problems into Doom</h2>
            <p>
                Economic systems rarely blow up from a single mistake. They break when feedback loops
                run for too long without being interrupted. Canada is already running several of these:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Deficit → Debt → Interest → Bigger deficit:</strong>
                    persistent deficits add to debt; rising rates increase interest costs; interest costs crowd out
                    other programs; the political answer is often more borrowing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Household fragility → Political pressure:</strong>
                    with households leveraged to the eyeballs, any attempt to normalize rates or cut spending
                    creates immediate pain. Politicians then lean on the central bank or promise new programs,
                    worsening the fiscal problem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy money → Asset bubbles → Political addiction:</strong>
                    low rates inflate housing and asset values. Voters feel rich, governments enjoy rising
                    property-tax and transaction revenues, and nobody wants to pop the bubble.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Inflation &amp; currency risk → Confidence erosion:</strong>
                    once domestic and foreign investors start doubting discipline, risk premiums rise,
                    the currency weakens, and imported inflation feeds into the next round.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Low productivity → Higher taxes → Even weaker growth:</strong>
                    instead of reform, the state leans on higher taxes and regulation, further depressing
                    the very investment needed to escape the trap.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Countries that refused to break these loops ended up like Argentina or Turkey.
                Countries that bit the bullet (1990s Canada, post-crisis Sweden, UK after its bond revolt)
                took real pain early to avoid something worse later. Canada today is closer to the first group
                than the second.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="pill-ok">Today:</span> Institutions still function, inflation can be controlled,
                    and markets still buy Canadian debt.

                <li>
                    <strong>Medium term:</strong> the structural trends (debt, demographics, housing, productivity)
                    all lean the wrong way. Every year of delay raises the cost of eventual repair.

                <li>
                    <strong>The “Japan excuse” is thin:</strong> pointing at Japan’s ultra-high debt ignores
                    deep differences in savings, culture, and monetary credibility.

                <li>
                    <strong>The politics are backward:</strong> the current political incentive structure punishes
                    hard decisions and rewards short-term giveaways that worsen the long-term math.

            <p>
                Calling the system “doomed” is not about a specific year or event.
                It’s about acknowledging that, under current rules and behaviour, the long-run
                equations do not balance. You either change the behaviour or you hit the wall.
