            <h2>1. The Setup: From “Safe” to Stretched</h2>
            <p>
                Since 2008 Canada has quietly traded balance-sheet strength for comfort:
                crisis-era stimulus never fully unwound, households levered into housing,
                and cheap money morphed into an assumption that low rates were permanent.

                The risk is not a single “bad number”; it’s the mix:
                governments comfortable with deficits, a central bank pressured from both sides,
                overleveraged households, and growth that can’t keep up if rates stay honest.

                <li><strong>Household debt:</strong> among the highest in advanced economies, tied to variable-rate mortgages.</li>
                <li><strong>Housing dependence:</strong> construction + real estate embedded into GDP, tax base, politics.</li>
                <li><strong>Weak productivity:</strong> low business investment, heavy regulation, lagging innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>CAD sensitivity:</strong> reliant on confidence, commodities, and policy credibility.</li>

                    If markets ever doubt Canada’s willingness to control deficits and inflation,
                    the correction will show up first in the currency and bond yields, not in speeches.

            </div>
            <h2>2. The Feedback Loops That Matter</h2>
            <p>
                Crises don’t start with hyperinflation. They start with loops policymakers fail to break:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deficit → Debt → Interest → Bigger deficit:</strong>
                    rising rates lift interest costs; governments borrow more to pay interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Debt → Central Bank Pressure:</strong>
                    the more painful honest rates get, the stronger the temptation to “lean dovish”.</li>
                <li><strong>Easy money → Housing &amp; debt boom:</strong>
                    asset inflation masks stagnating real wages and weak productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Inflation → Currency slide → More inflation:</strong>
                    once investors doubt discipline, FX and prices move together.</li>
                <li><strong>Household fragility → Political fear:</strong>
                    fear of defaults pushes leaders to choose inflation over visible austerity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Countries that lost control (Argentina, Turkey) rode these loops too long.
                Countries that pulled back (UK after its bond revolt, 1990s Canada)
                took the pain early and rebuilt credibility.
